cooling_2d.py  --  Paper 3, Section 5

A complete, runnable two-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard simulation of a cooling
sphalerite grain, producing the morphological sequence

    homogeneous  ->  spinodal decomposition  ->  coarsening  ->  arrest

and saving the concentration field at each stage.

    python cooling_2d.py                 # default: three cooling rates
    python cooling_2d.py --rate 3e-5     # a single rate
    python cooling_2d.py --quick         # small grid, for a fast check

WHAT IS BEING VARIED

Only one dimensionless quantity matters, the ratio of the cooling timescale to
the diffusive timescale. Cooling enters through an Arrhenius mobility: as T
falls, M(T) = M0 exp(-Ea/kB T) collapses, and coarsening -- which is driven by
curvature and limited by transport -- freezes. Fast cooling arrests the
microstructure early, leaving many small domains; slow cooling lets it run to
completion, leaving one. That competition is the physical content of the paper,
and it is what these runs display.

WHAT THE PICTURES DO AND DO NOT SHOW

They show the PATHWAY and the TOPOLOGY: which morphologies the system passes
through, whether coarsening completes or arrests, and how that depends on the
cooling rate. Those statements are dimensionless and are unaffected by the
numerical widening of the interface.

They do NOT show the absolute domain size. The characteristic length is
sqrt(kappa/|f''|); with kappa fixed from an atomically sharp interface it is of
order one lattice parameter, which no grid resolves, so kappa is inflated until
the interface spans four to six cells. Domain sizes here are therefore set by
the grid. Absolute sizes must come from direct lattice-model coarsening, where
the interface is what it physically is. Inflating kappa rescales lengths and
times together, so the dimensionless conclusions survive; the length axis of
every figure produced here is labelled in grid units for that reason.

    """
    Bulk free energy of the lattice model, in a form that can safely drive the
    dynamics.

    WHY NOT SIMPLY A POLYNOMIAL FIT

    The obvious step is to fit a quartic to the eight measured points and use
    its derivative. That fails, and the failure is instructive. A least-squares
    quartic through data spanning c = 0.005 to 0.20 comes out with a NEGATIVE
    leading coefficient, so f -> -infinity as c grows: at c = 1 the fitted f is
    -22.9 eV per site. Nothing in the dynamics keeps c inside the fitted window,
    and once a fluctuation carries a cell outside it the free energy rewards
    going further, so the field diverges within a few hundred steps. A
    polynomial fitted to a narrow window cannot serve as a global free energy.

    WHAT IS USED INSTEAD

    The measured points are embedded in a double well that is bounded below and
    grows without limit outside [0, 1]:

        f(c) = W c^2 (1-c)^2 + g(c),

    with W chosen so that the well dominates far from the measured range, and
    g(c) a low-order correction fitted to reproduce the measured points inside
    it. The double well supplies global stability and the two-phase structure;
    the correction supplies the measured shape where it was measured.

    This is a numerical device, not a physical claim. The manuscript diagnoses
    the instability by the common-tangent construction on the raw measurements,
    which requires neither fit nor differentiation. The role of f(c) here is to
    drive the dynamics with the right qualitative structure -- two coexisting
    compositions separated by a barrier -- and the arrest physics the paper
    concerns does not depend on the fine shape of the well.

    HOW COOLING IS PARAMETERISED, AND WHY NOT BY PHYSICAL TIME

    The mobility spans four orders of magnitude between T_hi and T_lo, so no
    single timestep serves both ends: one small enough to be stable while hot
    wastes millions of steps once cold, where nothing moves. The step is
    therefore adaptive,

        dt = cfl / ( M |f''|_max k_max^2 ),

    growing as M collapses.

    The cooling schedule is then specified in STEPS rather than in physical
    time, T descending linearly from T_hi to T_lo over n_cool_steps. This is
    deliberate. What controls the morphology is the ratio of the cooling rate to
    the coarsening rate, and because dt already tracks the mobility, a fixed
    number of steps per kelvin is a fixed amount of DIFFUSIVE PROGRESS per
    kelvin -- which is exactly the dimensionless ratio the paper is about.
    Specifying the schedule in physical time instead would make the fast-cooling
    runs terminate before the mobility had fallen at all, which is a statement
    about the units chosen rather than about the physics.

    A LARGE n_cool_steps therefore means SLOW cooling (much diffusion per
    kelvin) and a small one means FAST cooling. Physical time is accumulated
    alongside and reported.

    colour scale compresses every later panel into a narrow band and hides the
